# Background

A Pokemon-inspired RPG. Explore an overworld full of characters, trainers and wild monsters. Complex battle system, you are able to: choose a range of attacks with monsters and catch wild ones. Contains a lot of animations and visual details. Monsters can level up and evolve, while also learning new attacks on some levels. Visualizing all that information, there will be a monster index (similar to a Pokedex) that shows: stats, attacks and abilities of all of them.
